# Honey Production - Codecademy Project
#### Build a Machine Learning Model with Python
#### December 30, 2021

As you may have already heard, the honeybees are in a precarious state right now. You may have seen articles about the decline of the honeybee population for various reasons. This project investigates this decline and how the trends of the past predict the future (up to 2050) for the honeybees.

The available data is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/honey-production?select=honeyproduction.csv).
The information covers years 1998 - 2012 and is limited to the United States.

This project demonstrates the following operations: 
* Importing a DataFrame
* Creating a linear regression model on the data
* Preparing a plot of the data
* Predicting future values by extrapolating with linear regression model
